# GAME-Generalized-Approximate-Master-Equations

Code to integrate the Generalized Approximate Master Equations (GAME) model and its adaptive variant (A-GAME).

The code allows to reproduce the results in "The scales of hypergraph contagion: mechanisms, dynamical correlations, adaptation" by G. Burgio, G. St-Onge, and L. Hébert-Dufresne (under review). In particular, the .jld file contains the list of hyperedges extracted from real-world dataset of face-to-face interactions.
