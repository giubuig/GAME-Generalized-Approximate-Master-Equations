# GAME-Generalized-Approximate-Master-Equations

Code to integrate the Generalized Approximate Master Equations (GAME) model and its adaptive variant (A-GAME). The code allows to reproduce the results in "The scales of hypergraph contagion: mechanisms, dynamical correlations, adaptation" by G. Burgio, G. St-Onge, and L. HÃ©bert-Dufresne (under review).
